This is my personal Home Assistant configuration, to try to make my life easier and my home more confortable. 

I hope this will also help you get some inspiration to build your own smart home.

**Alberto** is the name of my smart home system. 

Why Alberto? Just because I think it is a funny name and sounds appropriate for a smart-home assistant/butler name üòÅ

The best way to discover new ideas and inspire is by [reading the code][github-url], copying-pasting parts of my configuration and adjusting it to your needs.

Read this documentation to see the bigger picture:

[Hardware](./hardware){: .md-button }
[Software](./software/system){: .md-button }
[Home Assistant](./home-assistant/introduction){: .md-button }
[Resources](./resources){: .md-button }

## What's inside?

My home setup for those who are too lazy to read everything:

- [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) as a home server.
- [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) for home automations.
- [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) and [zigbee2mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) for Zigbee devices.
- Reverse proxy using [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) with [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
- [AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome) for network-level ad-blocking.


## Motivation

I write this documentation for two main reasons:

1. **To keep track of growing my smart home.** To maintain an understanding of how things are working.
2. **To help other enthusiasts inspire.** People often ask about my smart home setup. Now I can give them a link to this documentation, instead of explaining everything once again.

## Future Plans

I have a [public Notion board](https://tan-chatter-25d.notion.site/1c5b8bb072ec46da926f884a9e73008d?v=8880922c4d3b4fcbbba7d076c50eb8d2) with ideas and tasks for my smart home. You can follow and comment my plans there.
