This is my Home Assistant configuration, to try to make my life easier and my home more confortable. 

I hope this will also help you get some inspiration to build your own smart home.

**Alberto** is the name of my smart home system. 

Why **Alberto**? Just because I think it is a funny name and sounds appropriate for a smart-home assistant/butler name üòÅ

The best way to understand how everything works, is by [checking the source code][github-url].

## What's inside?

tl;dr My home setup in a nutshell:

- [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) as a home server.
- [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) for home automations.
- [ZHA](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/) for Zigbee devices.
- Reverse proxy using [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) with [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).


## Motivation

I try to keep this documentation up-to-date for two main reasons:

1. **To keep track of my smart home setup.** To maintain an understanding of how things are working.
2. **To help other enthusiasts to build their smart home.** If you hire someone to do this for you, be ready to spend tons of money without understanding what is going on. There is nothing wrong with that approach if you don't have the patience or the time that it requires. But if you do, believe this will be fun!

## Future Plans

I have a [public Notion board](https://tan-chatter-25d.notion.site/1c5b8bb072ec46da926f884a9e73008d?v=8880922c4d3b4fcbbba7d076c50eb8d2) with ideas and tasks for my smart home. You can follow and comment my plans there.

## Buy me a coffee
Of course, this is a non-profit project. I am sharing this because, first I‚Äôm doing it for myself and second because sharing is caring, really üòè !

But I‚Äôve already spent countless hours to reach this point. So if you think I saved you already a couple of them, feel free to buy me a coffee:
