This is my personal Home Assistant configuration, to try to make my life easier and my home more confortable. 

I hope this will also help you get some inspiration to build your own smart home.

**Alberto** is the name of my smart home system. 

Why Alberto? Just because I think it is a funny name and sounds appropriate for a smart-home assistant/butler name üòÅ

## Inspiration
A big thumbs up to [Denys Dovhan][denysdovhan] that inspired me to work on my own home automation, without spending tons of money. :pray:
